# mock-akvo-caddifly

To easily mock caddisfly results, no caddisfly app install required, no need for sensors. The results will be random values from tests.json file. Just create a survey in flow with caddisfly and run the tests as usual. For actual results use the https://github.com/akvo/akvo-caddisfly app.
